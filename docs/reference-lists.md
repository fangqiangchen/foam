# Reference Lists

> This Recipe is a stub.

Use [[backlinking]] for handy reference lists:

- Add links like [[recommendation]], [[book]] etc.
- Create a page by that name and use its back links to see all todo's, recommendations, etc.
- Alternatively, highlight the `[[link]]` and `Cmd`+`Shift`+`F` to find all references without creating a page.
- [[todo]]: [[materialized-backlinks]] would be very useful here.

[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[backlinking]: backlinking.md "Backlinking"
[todo]: todo.md "Todo"
[materialized-backlinks]: materialized-backlinks.md "Materialized Backlinks (stub)"
[//end]: # "Autogenerated link references"
